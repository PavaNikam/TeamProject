Team Project was started in 2011 to design, implement and support cost-effective tailored software solutions using existing market leading software packages and development tools.

We use existing off-the-shelf software products (such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Accounts Packages), develop around, and integrate to them in order provide our clients with a software solution tailored to their needs at a fraction of the cost and time required for ground-up bespoke solutions.

In some cases, off-the-shelf solutions are not specific enough to meet our clients needs. In these cases, we are skilled at developing and onboarding specific bespoke solutions at a far more competitive price than our competitors.

We carefully examine our clientsâ€™ work processes and listen to their requirements to design user friendly, tailored solutions that complement existing workflows. Post-implementation training and ongoing user support ensures the successful implementation and longevity of the final solution.

We lend our many years of experience across many industry sectors, so our clients get the most from their software investment.
